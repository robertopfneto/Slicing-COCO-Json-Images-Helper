## General Instructions
You are an engineering assistant. You help creating code, debugging, and answering questions about engineering topics.

## About this script
- This script is help to create tiles dataset from roboflow.
- The dataset in the folder ./dataset/ and follows all the structure and name files as roboflow has.
- The challenge is to tiles the images and keep the bounding box notation
- The notation used for this dataset is COCO JSON.
- After creating any big changes, please, git commit
- The history section bellow is to add what you had done after each iteration.
  - Be brief with each history entry.
- you have to use the conda environment called `create-dataset` to run this script, or install new packages.

## History
- Created Configuration-Driven Architecture structure for dataset tiling application
- Implemented complete folder structure with config, core, services, models, and utils
- Added COCO dataset models and annotation management
- Created tiling engine with overlap support and annotation transformation
- Implemented dataset processor with image handling and validation
- Added command-line interface with environment variable configuration
- Created comprehensive documentation and example configuration
- Created bash scripts for easy execution with proper configuration
- Fixed COCO JSON parsing to handle extra fields from Roboflow export
- Added conda environment support with automatic creation and activation
- Created visualization tools to verify bounding box preservation in tiled images
- Added side-by-side comparison tools for original vs tiled datasets
- Fixed git mistake: removed commit with 40k generated images and added comprehensive .gitignore
- CRITICAL FIX: Fixed tiling logic that was incorrectly clipping bounding boxes to tile boundaries
- Analyzed annotation duplication at tile boundaries - found to be expected behavior for spanning objects
- Enhanced visualization scripts to show tile boundaries on original images for debugging
- MAJOR FIX: Fixed JPEG compression causing tile image corruption - identified root cause of "wrong annotations"
- Reverted to JPG format while preserving the critical bounding box coordinate fix
- Added comprehensive logging with progress indicators, timestamps, and periodic summaries
- FEATURE: Added resize functionality for tiles - creates 1024x1024 tiles and resizes to 512x512
- Updated tiling engine to support post-tile resizing with proper coordinate scaling
- Added coordinate transformation for annotations to match resized image dimensions
- Created dedicated analysis script for resized datasets (./create_resized_analysis.sh)
- Added bash script for easy resized tiling execution (./run_resized_tiling.sh)
- Fixed analysis script error: removed unsupported --title parameter from compare_datasets.py call
- FEATURE: Created dataset merger tool for combining multiple COCO datasets
- Implemented filename conflict resolution using dataset prefixes
- Added comprehensive ID remapping for images, annotations, and categories
- Created standalone merge_datasets.py script with full validation
- Added convenient merge_datasets.sh bash script for easy execution
- BUGFIX: Fixed dataset merger serialization error (dict object __dict__ issue)
- Corrected CocoInfo and CocoLicense object creation for proper COCO JSON serialization

## To-do
comment: I got the following error... 

```
üì¶ Creating unified dataset...
‚ùå Error during dataset merging: 'dict' object has no attribute '__dict__'

```
Does it related to the code or the datasets. It seems related to the code... Can you take a look?

- [x] See if the error is related to the code (merging datasets process pipeline  )
  - [x] Fix it if it's the case
